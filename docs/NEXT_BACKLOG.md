# Next Backlog

## High Priority (Pre-Launch)
- [x] Set up Cloudflare Tunnel for local dev with telephony webhooks (`scripts/dev-tunnel.sh`)
- [x] Configure production wrangler secrets (TWILIO_*, ADMIN_PUBKEY) — deployed and running
- [ ] Test full call flow end-to-end: incoming call -> CAPTCHA -> parallel ring -> answer -> notes -> hang up *(requires real phone + telephony account)*

## Security Audit Findings (2026-02-12, Round 4)

### Fixed (committed ddc95ec)
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Vonage webhook validation was `return true` — now HMAC-SHA256
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Caller phone hash leaked in spam report WS response
- [x] **HIGH**: Mass assignment — volunteer self-update now restricted to safe fields allowlist
- [x] **HIGH**: SSRF in provider test — ARI URL validation, internal IP blocking, fetch timeout
- [x] **HIGH**: ~~WebSocket flooding~~ — WebSocket removed; Nostr relay rate limiting replaces
- [x] **HIGH**: ~~WebSocket prototype pollution~~ — WebSocket removed; no longer applicable
- [x] **HIGH**: Weak KDF — upgraded SHA-256 concat to HKDF-SHA256 for note encryption
- [x] **HIGH**: Security headers — COOP, no-referrer, expanded CSP and Permissions-Policy

### Fixed (Round 4 medium, 6d3deac)
- [x] Session token revocation: logout API + server-side session delete
- [x] WebSocket call authorization: verify call state + volunteer ownership for answer/hangup/spam
- [x] Invite code rate limit: reduced from 10 to 5 per minute
- [x] Custom field label/option length validation: 200 char max
- [x] Presence broadcast: volunteers get `{ hasAvailable }` only, admins get full counts
- [ ] Encrypt/hash note metadata (callId, authorPubkey) to prevent correlation analysis — *trade-off: breaks server-side filtering/grouping; notes content is already E2EE*

## Security Audit Findings (2026-02-17, Round 5 — Epic 53)

### Fixed — CRITICAL
- [x] Login endpoint did not verify Schnorr signature — anyone knowing pubkey could enumerate roles
- [x] CAPTCHA expected digits stored in URL query params — attacker could see/modify; bypasses CAPTCHA
- [x] `Math.random()` used for CAPTCHA generation — predictable, not CSPRNG

### Fixed — HIGH
- [x] Invite redemption accepted arbitrary pubkey — no proof of private key ownership
- [x] Upload chunk/status endpoints had no ownership check
- [x] Sessions not revoked on volunteer deactivation/deletion
- [x] Plaintext nsec in onboarding backup — now encrypted with PBKDF2 + XChaCha20-Poly1305
- [x] HKDF called without salt for note encryption — added fixed application salt
- [x] Static PBKDF2 salt for recovery key derivation — now per-backup random salt
- [x] TwiML XML injection via HOTLINE_NAME — added `escapeXml()` function

### Fixed — MEDIUM
- [x] No rate limiting on WebAuthn login flow — added IP-based 10/min
- [x] CORS missing `Vary: Origin` header — cache poisoning risk
- [x] Reporter role could create/edit call notes — added role guard
- [x] WebAuthn userVerification "preferred" → "required"
- [x] IP hash truncated to 64 bits — increased to 96 bits
- [x] Asterisk webhook validation used `===` (non-constant-time) — now XOR comparison
- [x] Asterisk webhook had no timestamp replay protection — added 5-min window
- [x] Asterisk bridge bound to 0.0.0.0 — bound to 127.0.0.1

### Low / Future
- [x] Add auto-lock/panic-wipe mechanism for device seizure scenarios (triple-Escape trigger)
- [x] SRI hashes for PWA service worker cached assets (`sri-workbox-plugin.ts`)
- [x] Consider re-auth step-up for sensitive actions — PIN challenge dialog for phone unmask
- [ ] Auth token nonce-based replay protection *(accepted trade-off: mitigated by HTTPS + Schnorr + 5-min window + method/path binding)*

Threat model: [`docs/security/THREAT_MODEL.md`](security/THREAT_MODEL.md)
Deployment guide: [`docs/security/DEPLOYMENT_HARDENING.md`](security/DEPLOYMENT_HARDENING.md)

### Critical — Epic 64
- [x] ~~**C-1**: Caller phone number broadcast to ALL volunteers~~ — VERIFIED NOT VULNERABLE (already hashed + redacted server-side)
- [x] **C-2**: `codeql-action` uses mutable `@v3` tag — pinned to SHA
- [x] **C-3**: `git-cliff` binary downloaded without SHA256 verification — checksum added

### High — Epic 64
- [x] **H-1**: V1 legacy encryption still callable (no forward secrecy) — removed `encryptNote` export

- [x] **H-3**: Hub telephony provider config stored without validation — validation added
- [x] **H-4**: Demo nsec values compiled into all production bundles — dynamic import, code-split chunk
- [x] **H-5**: Docker Stage 3 resolves deps without lockfile — switched to bun with `--frozen-lockfile`
- [x] **H-6**: Asterisk `ARI_PASSWORD` has no required override in compose — added `:?` required syntax

### Medium — Epic 65
- [x] **M-1**: SSRF blocklist incomplete (IPv6, CGNAT, mapped addresses) — expanded blocklist with proper CIDR matching
- [x] **M-2**: `/calls/active` and `/calls/today-count` missing permission guards — added
- [x] **M-3**: `isAdmin` query param on internal DO API — replaced with dedicated `/admin/volunteers/:pubkey` DO route
- [x] **M-4**: Missing security headers in Worker — added CORP and X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies

- [x] **M-7**: File metadata ECIES uses wrong context string — fixed to `llamenos:file-metadata`
- [x] **M-8**: No JS dependency vulnerability scanning in CI — added `bun audit --audit-level=high` job gating releases
- [x] **M-9**: Floating Docker base image tags — pinned all images to SHA256 digests (Dockerfile, compose, Helm)
- [x] **M-10**: Helm NetworkPolicy missing PostgreSQL egress rule — added conditional TCP egress for postgres.port

### Low — Epic 67
- [x] **L-1**: `adminPubkey` in public config — moved to authenticated `/api/auth/me` response
- [x] **L-2**: Phone numbers unmasked in invite list and delete dialogs — applied `maskedPhone()` pattern
- [x] **L-3**: `keyPair.secretKey` propagated through React state — removed from auth context, all consumers use `keyManager.getSecretKey()` at point of use
- [x] **L-4**: Schnorr tokens not bound to request path — tokens now include method+path in signed message
- [x] **L-5**: Rate limiter off-by-one (`>` vs `>=`) — fixed
- [x] **L-6**: Shift time format not validated — added HH:MM regex validation
- [x] **L-7**: Document CSP `style-src 'unsafe-inline'` trade-off — added explanatory comment
- [x] **L-8**: Reduce Playwright trace artifact retention to 1 day — done
- [x] **L-9**: Add panic-wipe mechanism for device seizure (triple-Escape trigger + full wipe)

## Platform Hardening Sprint (2026-03-22) — Specs + Plans Ready

All items below have a design spec and implementation plan in `docs/superpowers/`. Agents should pick up plans from `docs/superpowers/plans/` and follow the `superpowers:executing-plans` skill.

### Critical Security — Execute First

- [x] **Security Hardening v2 Audit Backport** (`2026-03-22-security-hardening-v2-backport-plan.md`) — CRIT-H1 hub key membership check (verify first), HIGH-W1 relay key scoping, HIGH-W3 raw phone in audit log, HIGH-W4 dev endpoint 403→404, HIGH-W5 Twilio SID validation, MED-W1 cross-hub global routes, MED-W2 ban-by-phone admin-only, code quality fixes (empty catch blocks, offline queue race, `as any`, hardcoded CORS), workflow permissions least-privilege
- [x] **Volunteer PII Enforcement** (`2026-03-22-volunteer-pii-enforcement-plan.md`) — TypeScript-enforced `projectVolunteer()` with discriminated union (`view: 'public'|'self'|'admin'`), correct E.164 `maskPhone()`, covers all volunteer-returning endpoints including `PATCH /:targetPubkey`

### Platform & CI/CD

- [x] **CI Pipeline Hardening** (`2026-03-22-ci-security-hardening-plan.md`) — GPG signing for releases (CHECKSUMS.txt.asc uploaded to GitHub Release), gitleaks secret scanning, Dependabot for bun/cargo/actions, SECURITY.md, workflow permissions per-job. **Operator action required**: generate CI GPG keypair and set RELEASE_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY + RELEASE_GPG_KEY_ID secrets.
- [x] **CI VPS Auto-Deploy** (`2026-03-22-ci-vps-auto-deploy-plan.md`) — `auto-deploy-demo.yml` triggers on `release:published`, polls for Docker image in GHCR, deploys via Ansible with `llamenos_image` override, health endpoint verification. Site auto-deploy added to `ci.yml` (CF Pages on `site/` changes). `rollback-demo` recipe added to justfile. **Operator action required**: set `CF_API_TOKEN` + `CF_ACCOUNT_ID` secrets for site deploy.
- [x] **Ops: PostgreSQL Backup & Recovery** (`2026-03-22-ops-backup-recovery-plan.md`) — Audited existing role (already complete); fixed test-restore table names (CF→Drizzle), added backup freshness to `/api/health`, restore.yml playbook, restore-postgres.sh script, docs/ops/restore-runbook.md, justfile recipes (backup-demo, test-restore-demo, restore-demo)
- [x] **Ops: MinIO Init + Systemd Service** (`2026-03-22-minio-init-systemd-plan.md`) — `init-minio.sh` (bucket, lifecycle rules, llamenos-app IAM user), app now uses MINIO_APP_USER/PASSWORD (least-privilege), health endpoint checks HeadBucket, systemd unit via Ansible (`llamenos.service.j2`)
- [x] **CF Removal / Drizzle Migration — Schema Corrections** (`2026-03-22-drizzle-schema-completeness-addendum.md`) — Subscribers privacy refactor (identifierHash, channels JSONB, status enum, preferenceToken), blasts (targetChannels/targetTags/targetLanguages arrays, stats JSONB), blast_settings, note_replies, GDPR tables (gdpr_consents, gdpr_erasure_requests, retention_settings), geocoding_config, hubs.allowSuperAdminAccess, hub_keys ephemeralPubkey+createdAt, customFieldDefinitions.context, file_records.hubId. Migration 0003 written manually (drizzle-kit TTY limitation). Updated BlastService, routes, messaging router, preferences endpoints.

### Application Quality

- [x] **Application Hardening Phase 3** (`2026-03-22-application-hardening-phase3-plan.md`) — Audited: auth middleware already clean (no `as any`), `profileCompleted` wiring verified correct, on-break filtering confirmed in `startParallelRinging`, active calls dashboard widget already present, call history pagination already implemented. Discovery phases (3.5/3.6/3.9) deferred pending new specs.
- [x] **GDPR Compliance** (`2026-03-22-gdpr-compliance-plan.md`) — Consent gate, data export, right to erasure (72h delay), retention purge job, admin UI

### Test Coverage

> Implement shared helpers first (`tests/helpers/` migration from flat `tests/helpers.ts`) — prerequisite for all suites.

- [x] **Shared Test Helpers** — `tests/helpers/` directory: `auth.ts` (login helpers), `crypto.ts` (key preloading), `db.ts` (resetTestState, createTestHub, deleteTestHub), `call-simulator.ts` (simulateInboundCall, simulateCallAnswered, simulateCallHungUp, simulateVoicemail, waitForCallState); `index.ts` re-exports all; existing `from './helpers'` imports resolve transparently
- [x] **Call Flow Tests** (`2026-03-22-call-flow-tests-plan.md`) — ring → answer → note → hangup → voicemail fallback → parallel ringing. Inbound webhook is two-step: `POST /telephony/incoming` then `POST /telephony/language-selected`.

- [x] **E2EE Verification Tests** (`2026-03-22-e2ee-verification-tests-plan.md`) — Server stores ciphertext only; `window.__llamenos_test_crypto` hook (VITE_TEST_MODE guard); multi-envelope decryption; forward secrecy
- [x] **Nostr Relay Tests** (`2026-03-22-nostr-relay-tests-plan.md`) — `call:ring` event published and encrypted; hub key extracted via `window.__llamenos_test_hub_key`; REST polling fallback
- [x] **Spam Mitigation Tests** (`2026-03-22-spam-mitigation-tests-plan.md`) — Ban enforcement, rate limiting, CAPTCHA toggle (correct/wrong digits), priority: ban > rate-limit > CAPTCHA
- [x] **PWA Offline Tests** (`2026-03-22-pwa-offline-tests-plan.md`) — SW registration, offline banner, API not cached, queue sends on reconnect
- [x] **WebAuthn Registration Tests** (`2026-03-22-webauthn-registration-tests-plan.md`) — Virtual authenticator via CDP, passkey register/login, multi-device, session revocation
- [x] **i18n Locale Tests** (`2026-03-22-i18n-locale-tests-plan.md`) — All 13 locales, RTL Arabic, dynamic locale file comparison (no hardcoded strings), `scripts/check-locales.ts` with nested key traversal
- [x] **Provider Simulation Suite** (`2026-03-22-provider-simulation-suite-plan.md`) — Payload factory + proxy simulation endpoints for all 5 telephony providers × 9 events and all 4 messaging channels. Asterisk-first build order. Dev bypass added to messaging router. E2E tests assert 200/404 (not 400/403/500) for all provider × event combinations.

### Contact Directory v2 — Specs (Draft, Needs Review)

> All specs below are drafts from 2026-03-28 brainstorming. They need review against the codebase and may need revision after Spec 0 (PBAC redesign) lands or other work changes assumptions. Review each spec before writing an implementation plan.

**Dependency order:** 0 → 1 → (2, 3 parallel) → 4 → 5 → 6

- [ ] **Spec 0: User Identity & PBAC Redesign** (`2026-03-28-user-identity-pbac-redesign.md`) — FOUNDATION. Rename volunteer→user, strongly-typed hierarchical permission scoping (`:own` ⊃ `:assigned` ⊃ `:all`), permission catalog with metadata for admin-friendly role editor, new Case Manager default role. ~109 files touched.
- [ ] **Spec 1: Tag Management** (`2026-03-28-tag-management.md`) — Admin-defined tag vocabulary with colors/categories, autocomplete, `tags:create` permission, strict mode toggle, GIN index for server-side filtering, default tag seeds.
- [ ] **Spec 2: Contact Profile Actions** (`2026-03-28-contact-profile-actions.md`) — Contact channels model (SMS/Signal username/WhatsApp/Telegram/email), notify support contacts via preferred channel, add report from contact view, relationship permission documentation.
- [ ] **Spec 3: Call-to-Contact Workflow** (`2026-03-28-call-to-contact-workflow.md`) — Add/link contacts from call detail page, client-side regex extraction of phone/name/email from transcripts, post-call contact creation flow, convenience API endpoints.
- [ ] **Spec 4: Bulk Operations** (`2026-03-28-bulk-operations.md`) — Multi-select in directory, bulk tag/untag, bulk risk level, bulk soft delete, bulk message blast to contacts via preferred channels. Depends on Spec 1 (tags) + Spec 2 (channels).
- [ ] **Spec 5: Post-Call Data Entry** (`2026-03-28-post-call-data-entry.md`) — Permission-scoped intake forms for volunteers, triage queue for case managers, encrypted intake submissions merged into contact records. New `contact_intakes` table + `contacts:triage` permission.
- [ ] **Spec 6: Contact Import/Export & Merging** (`2026-03-28-contact-import-export-merging.md`) — Client-side CSV import with dedup, encrypted JSON export, side-by-side merge UI, duplicate detection. Batch API + `mergedInto` column.

### Security Fixes — Pending

- [ ] **Unknown API routes should return 404 instead of 401** — Auth middleware runs before route matching, so unauthenticated requests to non-existent routes get 401 (reveals route doesn't exist but requires auth). Fix: move route matching before auth middleware, or add a catch-all 404 handler after all routes that returns 404 regardless of auth state.

### Test Quality — Status (2026-03-23)

**Verified 100% passing suites (19 files, 200 tests):**
admin-flow (18), blast-sending (8), notes-crud (7), smoke (4), theme (7), health-config (5), auth-guards (7), audit-log (6), volunteer-flow (9), profile-settings (13), ban-management (13), form-validation (8), login-restore (10), blasts (7), call-spam (5) + unit tests (25) + provider-capabilities (20), credential-encryption (4), provider-health (5), asterisk-auto-config (8)

**Known remaining issues:**
- [ ] **roles.spec.ts** — 6/28 tests fail: serial chain cascade (role update fails after create; reporter/custom role hub context 400 vs 403)
- [ ] **Hub-scoped API calls from non-hub-member volunteers** return 400 (hub context required) instead of 403 (permission denied) — tests accept both
- [ ] **conversations.spec.ts** — setup wizard flow is fragile; mostly smoke tests; needs real message send/receive tests when providers are configured
- [ ] **hub-access-control.spec.ts** — 1/4 tests fail (missing data-testid="hub-access-toggle")

## App Bugs Found During Test Restructuring (2026-03-24)

- [ ] **CAPTCHA retry not implemented** — `captchaMaxAttempts` setting exists and is persisted, but the server's `/telephony/captcha` route deletes challenge state after first attempt (one-shot). Wrong digits always return `<Hangup/>` regardless of remaining attempts. Route should track attempt count and re-Gather until max attempts reached. Test: `voice-captcha.spec.ts` test 5.4 (marked as `test.fixme`).
- [ ] **Dashboard incoming calls require Nostr relay** — The dashboard `useCalls()` hook gets call events exclusively from the Nostr relay WebSocket subscription. There is no REST polling fallback for incoming calls. If the relay is down or the page reloads mid-call, the incoming call card does not appear. Tests: `call-flow.spec.ts` (skip when relay unavailable).
- [ ] **Drizzle migration journal out of sync** — Migrations 0004, 0005, 0008, 0009, 0010 were in SQL files but missing from the journal or not applied to the dev database. Root cause: worktree-based development may have lost migration state. Applied manually during test restructuring.
- [ ] **TwiML callback URLs use /api/telephony/ prefix** — The TwilioAdapter generates TwiML with action URLs like `/api/telephony/wait-music` and `/api/telephony/queue-exit`, but these routes are under the authenticated `/api/` mount. Twilio callbacks to these URLs would fail auth. Should use `/telephony/` (unauthenticated webhook routes).

## Storage & Infrastructure — Future Work

- [x] **LUKS volume encryption for RustFS data** — dm-crypt/LUKS Ansible role (`luks.yml`), opt-in via `luks_enabled`. Defense-in-depth beneath SSE-S3 + E2EE.
- [x] **Per-hub IAM credentials** — Per-hub IAM users with bucket-scoped policies via RustFS admin API. Credentials encrypted at rest with HKDF + XChaCha20-Poly1305.
- [x] **Export-then-destroy on hub deletion** — Category checklist dialog + `GET /api/hubs/:hubId/export` JSON download. i18n for 13 locales.
- [ ] **External KMS for SSE-KMS** — Replace RustFS-managed keys (SSE-S3) with Hashicorp Vault or similar for key management. For deployments with higher compliance requirements.

## Data Layer — Future Work

- [x] **React Query for fetch + decrypt** — Completed in react-query refactor PR #28.
- [ ] **Eliminate remaining decryptHubField calls** — 53 usages of `decryptHubField` still in 10+ component files (shifts, blasts, hubs, contacts, etc.). Each should be moved to the respective React Query `queryFn` following the decrypt-in-queryFn pattern established in roles.ts. Also remove `hub-field-crypto.ts` once all callsites are migrated.
