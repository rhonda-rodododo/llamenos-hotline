## 1. Admin Key Compromise Response

The admin keypair is the most privileged credential in the system. Compromise of the admin nsec grants the attacker the ability to decrypt all admin-wrapped note envelopes, all admin-wrapped message envelopes, and (if the admin held the hub key) all hub-encrypted Nostr events. This is the highest-severity key compromise scenario.

**Responsible party**: The administrator (or a designated backup administrator with access to deployment infrastructure).

### 1.1 Immediate Actions (within 1 hour of confirmed compromise)

These steps must be completed as fast as possible. The goal is to revoke the compromised keypair and prevent further use.

1. **Generate a new admin keypair** on a trusted machine (not the compromised device):
   ```bash
   bun run bootstrap-admin
   ```
   Record the new public key securely. Do not transmit it over any channel the attacker may control.

2. **Reset the admin's IdP password** in Authentik (if applicable):
   ```bash
   # Disable the compromised admin user in Authentik to prevent IdP value retrieval
   docker compose exec app curl -sf -X PATCH \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTHENTIK_API_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"is_active": false}' \
     "http://authentik-server:9000/api/v3/core/users/<user_pk>/"
   ```

3. **Bulk-revoke all JWT refresh tokens** for the compromised admin:
   ```sql
   -- Run against the app database
   INSERT INTO jwt_revocations (jti, pubkey, expires_at, created_at)
   SELECT jti, pubkey, expires_at, NOW()
   FROM jwt_active_tokens  -- or revoke all for the pubkey
   WHERE pubkey = '<compromised_admin_pubkey>';
   ```
   If a `jwt_active_tokens` table does not exist, revoke by inserting a sentinel:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO jwt_revocations (jti, pubkey, expires_at)
   VALUES ('BULK_REVOKE_' || '<compromised_admin_pubkey>', '<compromised_admin_pubkey>', NOW() + INTERVAL '24 hours');
   ```

4. **Update the deployment configuration** with the new admin public key:
   ```bash
   cd /opt/llamenos/deploy/docker
   sed -i "s|^ADMIN_PUBKEY=.*|ADMIN_PUBKEY=<new_pubkey>|" .env
   ```

5. **Redeploy the application** to apply the new admin pubkey:
   ```bash
   docker compose restart app
   ```
   This invalidates all active in-memory state. Combined with JWT revocation, the compromised admin is fully locked out.

6. **Verify the deployment** is running with the new key:
   ```bash
   docker compose exec app curl -sf http://localhost:3000/api/health
   ```

7. **Begin hub key rotation** immediately (see [Section 4](#4-hub-key-rotation-ceremony)). Do not wait for the 24-hour window -- start now.

### 1.2 Short-Term Actions (within 24 hours)

8. **Complete hub key rotation** (Section 4). The new hub key must be distributed to all active members. The maximum deadline for hub key rotation to begin is 4 hours from confirmed compromise; it must be completed within 24 hours.

9. **Re-wrap all admin note envelopes** with the new admin public key. This requires a re-encryption pass:
   - For each note in the system, the volunteer who authored it must be online to re-wrap their note's admin envelope using the new admin pubkey.
   - Notes whose authors are offline cannot be re-wrapped until those volunteers reconnect.
   - Track re-wrapping progress in the admin UI.

10. **Re-wrap all admin message envelopes** with the new admin public key, following the same process as note envelopes.

11. **Review the audit log** for anomalous access patterns during the compromise window:
   - Unusual login times or IP addresses
   - Bulk data access or export
   - Settings or configuration changes
   - Volunteer account modifications

### 1.3 Assessment

12. **Determine what data was accessible** to the attacker. The compromised admin key could decrypt:
    - All note envelopes wrapped for the admin pubkey
    - All message envelopes wrapped for the admin pubkey
    - If the admin held the hub key: all hub-encrypted Nostr events (past and present, until hub key rotation completes)

13. **Assess GDPR notification obligations**. If personal data of callers or volunteers may have been exposed, you must notify the supervisory authority within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach. Prepare a report covering:
    - Nature of the breach and compromised key type
    - Categories and approximate number of data subjects affected
    - Likely consequences of the compromise
    - Measures taken (key rotation, re-wrapping, session invalidation)

14. **Notify affected parties** per your organization's breach notification policy and GDPR requirements.

**Maximum response timeframe**: Hub key rotation must BEGIN within 4 hours of confirmed compromise. All immediate actions (steps 1-7) must be completed within 1 hour. Short-term actions (steps 8-11) must be completed within 24 hours.

### 1.4 Verification Checklist

After completing all admin key compromise response actions, verify:

- [ ] New admin keypair is active — admin can log in with the new nsec
- [ ] Old admin keypair is rejected — login attempt with old nsec fails
- [ ] Old admin disabled in Authentik — IdP value no longer retrievable
- [ ] All JWT refresh tokens for old admin are revoked — check `jwt_revocations` table
- [ ] Hub key has been rotated — test by publishing a hub event and verifying active members can decrypt
- [ ] All active volunteer sessions are functional — at least one volunteer confirms they can decrypt notes
- [ ] Audit log shows the compromise response actions (key rotation, session invalidation, IdP disable)
- [ ] GDPR notification has been filed (if applicable) within the 72-hour window
- [ ] Re-wrapping progress is tracked — note which volunteers' envelopes have been re-wrapped

## 2. Volunteer Key Revocation on Departure

When a volunteer leaves the organization, their cryptographic keys must be revoked to prevent access to future data. The procedure differs depending on whether the departure is cooperative (friendly) or adversarial (hostile).

**Responsible party**: An administrator.

### 2.1 Friendly Departure

The volunteer is cooperating and leaving on good terms. They may retain their nsec (we cannot force deletion from their devices), but they will lose access to all future data.

1. **Deactivate the volunteer** via the admin UI:
   - Navigate to Volunteers > [volunteer name] > Deactivate
   - This immediately revokes all active JWT sessions for the volunteer

2. **Disable the volunteer in Authentik** — prevents IdP value retrieval on any device, blocking key unlock even if they retain their PIN.

3. **Revoke all JWT refresh tokens** for the volunteer:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO jwt_revocations (jti, pubkey, expires_at)
   VALUES ('DEPART_' || '<volunteer_pubkey>', '<volunteer_pubkey>', NOW() + INTERVAL '24 hours');
   ```

4. **Confirm session revocation** -- the volunteer should be logged out of all devices. Verify no active sessions remain in the admin panel.

5. **Rotate the hub key** immediately (see [Section 4](#4-hub-key-rotation-ceremony)):
   - Generate a new random hub key
   - Distribute the new hub key to all remaining active members
   - The departed volunteer does NOT receive the new key

6. **Verify post-departure access boundaries**:
   - The departed volunteer CAN still decrypt notes they authored (they have the author envelope keys from when they were active). This is acceptable -- they authored those notes.
   - The departed volunteer CANNOT decrypt new hub events (new hub key).
   - The departed volunteer CANNOT decrypt other volunteers' notes (they never had those keys).
   - The departed volunteer CAN prove they were a member (their pubkey was registered). Consider whether this is a concern for your threat model.

7. **Document the departure** in the audit log with the date, reason, and confirmation that hub key rotation was completed.

#### Friendly Departure Verification Checklist

- [ ] Volunteer is deactivated in the admin UI (status: inactive)
- [ ] Volunteer is disabled in Authentik
- [ ] All JWT refresh tokens revoked for the volunteer
- [ ] No active sessions remain for the volunteer
- [ ] Hub key has been rotated — new key distributed to all remaining members
- [ ] At least one remaining member confirms they can decrypt new hub events
- [ ] Departure documented in audit log

### 2.2 Hostile Departure

The volunteer is leaving on bad terms, has been terminated, or is suspected of acting against the organization's interests. Treat this as a potential security incident.

1. **Deactivate the volunteer immediately** via the admin UI. If the admin UI is not accessible, deactivate via the database:
   ```bash
   docker compose exec postgres psql -U llamenos -d llamenos -c "
     UPDATE users SET active = false WHERE pubkey = '<volunteer_pubkey>';
   "
   docker compose restart app
   ```

2. **Disable the volunteer in Authentik** immediately — prevents IdP value retrieval:
   ```bash
   docker compose exec app curl -sf -X PATCH \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTHENTIK_API_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"is_active": false}' \
     "http://authentik-server:9000/api/v3/core/users/?username=<volunteer_pubkey>"
   ```

3. **Bulk-revoke all JWT tokens** for the volunteer:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO jwt_revocations (jti, pubkey, expires_at)
   VALUES ('HOSTILE_DEPART_' || '<volunteer_pubkey>', '<volunteer_pubkey>', NOW() + INTERVAL '24 hours');
   ```

4. **Rotate the hub key immediately** (see [Section 4](#4-hub-key-rotation-ceremony)). Do not delay.

5. **Revoke all WebAuthn credentials** associated with the volunteer's devices via the admin UI.

6. **Conduct an access assessment** -- determine what data the hostile volunteer had access to during their tenure:
   - Which notes did they author or have access to?
   - Which hub events were encrypted with keys they possessed?
   - Did they have access to any shared resources or admin-level data?
   - Review audit logs for any data exfiltration patterns (bulk access, unusual export activity).

7. **Assess whether further action is needed** based on the access assessment:
   - If the volunteer had access to sensitive caller data, consider GDPR notification obligations.
   - If the volunteer had access to other volunteers' identities, notify those volunteers.
   - If the volunteer had admin-level access at any point, treat this as an admin key compromise (Section 1).

8. **Document the incident** thoroughly in the audit log and any incident tracking system.

#### Hostile Departure Verification Checklist

- [ ] Volunteer is deactivated in the app — no active sessions remain
- [ ] Volunteer is disabled in Authentik — IdP value no longer retrievable
- [ ] All JWT refresh tokens revoked for the volunteer
- [ ] Hub key has been rotated — departed volunteer's pubkey excluded from key distribution
- [ ] All WebAuthn credentials for the volunteer are revoked
- [ ] Access assessment documented — what data the volunteer had access to during tenure
- [ ] GDPR notification filed (if applicable)
- [ ] Other volunteers notified (if their identities were accessible to the departed volunteer)
- [ ] Incident documented in audit log and any external incident tracking

## 3. Device Seizure Response

A volunteer's device has been physically seized (by law enforcement, border agents, adversaries, or through theft). The threat is that the attacker gains physical access to the device and attempts to extract cryptographic keys from local storage.

**Responsible party**: The affected volunteer (for panic wipe) and an administrator (for hub key rotation and credential revocation).

### 3.1 Panic Wipe (Volunteer Action)

If the volunteer still has momentary access to the device before seizure:

1. **Trigger the panic wipe** using the triple-Escape mechanism (press Escape three times rapidly). This:
   - Zeroes the nsec from the in-memory closure
   - Clears the PIN-encrypted key store from local storage
   - Clears all session data
   - Navigates to a neutral page

2. **Confirm the wipe completed** -- the device should show no trace of the Llamenos application state. The PWA is named "Hotline" with a generic icon, which provides additional cover.

### 3.2 Hub-Side Response (Administrator Action)

Whether or not the panic wipe was successful, the administrator must assume the worst case:

3. **Assess whether panic wipe occurred**. Contact the volunteer through a secure side channel (not the seized device) to determine:
   - Was the panic wipe triggered before seizure?
   - Was the device locked (screen lock active) at the time of seizure?
   - Was the device powered on or off?

4. **If panic wipe was NOT possible** (or uncertain):
   - **Deactivate the volunteer** immediately via the admin UI
   - **Rotate the hub key** immediately (see [Section 4](#4-hub-key-rotation-ceremony))
   - **Revoke all WebAuthn credentials** for the seized device

5. **If panic wipe WAS confirmed**:
   - The nsec and key store have been cleared from the device
   - PIN protection on the local key store provides a time buffer -- even if the attacker recovers deleted data, they must crack the PIN to access the nsec
   - Hub key rotation is still recommended as a precaution, but the urgency is lower

6. **Revoke WebAuthn credentials** for the seized device via the admin UI, regardless of whether panic wipe occurred. Physical possession of the device may allow the attacker to use stored WebAuthn credentials.

### 3.3 Multi-Factor Key Protection Assessment

The volunteer's nsec is stored encrypted under a multi-factor KEK. Key reconstruction requires:

1. **PIN** — user-chosen, 4-8+ digits
2. **IdP value** — random 32-byte secret stored in Authentik (encrypted with `IDP_VALUE_ENCRYPTION_KEY`)
3. **WebAuthn PRF output** (if enabled) — authenticator-derived value, requires physical authenticator

| Factors Available to Attacker | Brute-force Difficulty | Assessment |
|-------------------------------|----------------------|------------|
| Device only (no IdP value) | PIN alone insufficient — missing IdP factor | **Strong** — attacker needs server access too |
| Device + Authentik DB dump (no encryption key) | IdP values are encrypted; PIN still needed | **Strong** — two unknowns |
| Device + decrypted IdP value | PIN brute-force only barrier | **Marginal** — similar to old PIN-only model |
| Device + decrypted IdP value + WebAuthn PRF | Need physical authenticator | **Strong** — hardware factor blocks offline attack |

**Key improvement over PIN-only**: Even if the attacker cracks the PIN, they cannot reconstruct the KEK without the IdP value. Admin can immediately disable the user in Authentik to prevent IdP value retrieval via the API, and revoke all JWT tokens to prevent session reuse.

Hub key rotation should still begin within 1 hour of confirmed device seizure as a defense-in-depth measure.

### 3.4 Post-Seizure Volunteer Re-Onboarding

After the incident is resolved and if the volunteer continues with the organization:

7. **Generate a new invite** for the volunteer to onboard with a fresh keypair on a new device. The new enrollment will generate a fresh IdP value in Authentik and a new multi-factor KEK.
8. **The volunteer's old notes remain accessible** to the admin (admin envelope) but the volunteer will not be able to access their historical notes from the new keypair unless they retained a backup of their old nsec.
9. **Brief the volunteer** on any changes to operational security procedures. Recommend enabling WebAuthn PRF on the new device for three-factor key protection.

## 4. Hub Key Rotation Ceremony

The hub key is a shared symmetric key used to encrypt Nostr relay events that are broadcast to all members (e.g., shift changes, presence updates, system announcements). When a member departs or a key is compromised, the hub key must be rotated so that former members cannot decrypt future events.

**Responsible party**: An administrator.

**Prerequisites**: The hub key rotation mechanism is designed in Epic 76.2. This section documents the operational ceremony; the implementation details are in the epic.

### 4.1 Preparation

1. **Identify all active members** who must receive the new hub key. This includes all active volunteers and all administrators. Verify the list in the admin UI under Volunteers (filter: active only).

2. **Confirm the reason for rotation** and document it:
   - Admin key compromise (Section 1)
   - Volunteer departure -- friendly (Section 2.1)
   - Volunteer departure -- hostile (Section 2.2)
   - Device seizure (Section 3)
   - Routine rotation (annual or per policy)

3. **Ensure you have a secure connection** to the admin interface. Do not perform key rotation over an untrusted network.

### 4.2 Rotation Steps

4. **Generate a new random 32-byte hub key**:
   - The admin UI provides a "Rotate Hub Key" function
   - Alternatively, the admin client generates the key locally: `crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(32))`
   - The hub key is random bytes — NOT derived from any identity key. This ensures no mathematical link between old and new hub keys

5. **Wrap the new hub key for each remaining member** via ECIES using each member's public key:
   - The admin client iterates over all active member pubkeys
   - For each member, it performs ECIES encryption of the new hub key using the domain label `"llamenos:hub-key-wrap"`
   - This produces one wrapped key blob per member

6. **Publish a key rotation event** to the Nostr relay:
   - The event is encrypted with the OLD hub key (so current members can read it)
   - The event contains a reference to the new key version and instructs clients to unwrap their individual key blob
   - Event kind and format are defined in Epic 76.2

7. **Each active member's client receives the rotation event**:
   - The client decrypts the rotation event using the old hub key
   - The client retrieves its individually-wrapped new hub key blob
   - The client unwraps the new hub key using its own nsec
   - The client stores the new hub key locally, indexed by version

8. **Events published after rotation use the new key version**:
   - All new hub events are encrypted with the new hub key
   - Clients include the key version identifier in encrypted events

9. **The old hub key is retained** by clients for decrypting historical events:
   - Clients maintain a key version history
   - When decrypting an event, the client selects the correct key version based on the event's key version identifier

10. **Departed or revoked members do NOT receive the new key**:
    - They are excluded from step 5 (no wrapped key blob generated for them)
    - They can still decrypt historical events encrypted with old key versions they possessed
    - They cannot decrypt any events encrypted with the new key

### 4.3 Verification

11. **Verify rotation success** by checking that active members can decrypt new hub events:
    - Have at least one volunteer confirm they received and can read a test hub event
    - Check the admin UI for key rotation status (members who have acknowledged the new key)

12. **Monitor for rotation failures** over the next 24 hours:
    - Members who were offline during rotation will receive the wrapped key when they reconnect
    - If a member cannot unwrap their key blob, re-wrap and re-publish for that member

#### Hub Key Rotation Verification Checklist

- [ ] New hub key generated and distributed to all active members
- [ ] At least one volunteer confirms they can decrypt a test hub event
- [ ] Departed/revoked members excluded from key distribution
- [ ] Old hub key retained by clients for historical event decryption
- [ ] Key rotation event visible in audit log
- [ ] Monitor for 24 hours for rotation failures (offline members)

### 4.4 Rotation Failure Recovery

If the rotation ceremony fails (e.g., admin client crashes mid-rotation, network failure during publishing):

13. **Do NOT re-use a partially distributed key.** Generate a fresh hub key and restart from step 4.

14. If members received a partial rotation (some have the new key, some do not):
    - Publish a cancellation event encrypted with the old hub key, instructing clients to discard the failed key version
    - Restart the ceremony with a new key

### 4.5 Emergency Hub Key Rotation via CLI

If the admin UI is not accessible (e.g., server partially down, admin locked out of UI), the hub key can be rotated using the admin nsec directly:

1. Obtain the list of active member pubkeys from the database:
   ```bash
   docker compose exec postgres psql -U llamenos -d llamenos -c "
     SELECT pubkey FROM users WHERE active = true;
   "
   ```

2. Generate a new hub key and wrap it for each member. This requires running the admin client-side crypto code outside the browser (e.g., via a Node.js script using the admin nsec). A convenience script is planned for future releases.

3. Publish the key rotation event to the Nostr relay using the server's Nostr identity.

**Note**: CLI rotation is an emergency-only procedure. The admin UI handles all the cryptographic operations automatically and is the recommended approach.

---

## 5. IdP and JWT Session Revocation

This section covers session-level revocation procedures that complement key-level revocation. These procedures provide immediate lockout without requiring hub key rotation.

### 5.1 IdP-Level User Disable (Immediate Lockout)

Disabling a user in Authentik immediately prevents them from:
- Retrieving their IdP value (required to unlock their nsec)
- Refreshing JWT tokens (IdP session check fails)
- Enrolling new devices

```bash
# Disable a user in Authentik (replace <user_pk> with the Authentik user PK)
docker compose exec app curl -sf -X PATCH \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTHENTIK_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"is_active": false}' \
  "http://authentik-server:9000/api/v3/core/users/<user_pk>/"
```

**Effect**: The user's existing JWT access token remains valid until expiry (max 15 minutes). After that, token refresh fails. For immediate cutoff, combine with JWT revocation (Section 5.2).

### 5.2 Per-Device JWT Session Revocation

To revoke a specific device's session (e.g., a seized device while keeping the user's other devices active):

```sql
-- Revoke a specific refresh token by jti
INSERT INTO jwt_revocations (jti, pubkey, expires_at)
VALUES ('<specific_jti>', '<pubkey>', '<token_expires_at>');
```

The `jti` can be found in the audit log (logged on token issuance) or by decoding the JWT.

### 5.3 Bulk JWT Revocation (All Sessions for a User)

To revoke all sessions for a user across all devices:

```sql
-- Insert a bulk revocation marker
-- The app server checks for pubkey-level revocations
INSERT INTO jwt_revocations (jti, pubkey, expires_at)
VALUES (
  'BULK_' || gen_random_uuid()::text,
  '<pubkey>',
  NOW() + INTERVAL '24 hours'
);
```

**Note**: Existing access tokens (up to 15 minutes old) will continue to work until they expire. For true immediate lockout, restart the app server to clear any in-memory token caches.

### 5.4 Re-Enrollment Flow

After a user has been disabled and their sessions revoked, re-enrollment requires:

1. **Re-enable the user in Authentik** (or create a new user if the pubkey is changing)
2. **Generate a new invite code** via the admin UI
3. **The user completes enrollment** on their new/clean device:
   - New keypair generated in-browser (if pubkey change)
   - New IdP value generated and stored in Authentik
   - New multi-factor KEK derived from PIN + new IdP value + optional WebAuthn PRF
   - New hub key distributed via ECIES
4. **Verify** the user can decrypt hub events and access their assigned data

### 5.5 Verification Checklist

- [ ] User disabled in Authentik (if applicable)
- [ ] JWT refresh tokens revoked in `jwt_revocations` table
- [ ] User cannot refresh tokens (returns 401)
- [ ] User cannot retrieve IdP value (returns 403 or user-not-found)
- [ ] After access token expires (15min), user is fully locked out
- [ ] Re-enrollment completed successfully (if applicable)
